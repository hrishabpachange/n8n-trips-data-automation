#📊 n8n Trips Data Automation

An end-to-end **workflow automation system** built using **n8n** to streamline trip data management for a tourism / car rental business.  
The system automates trip data collection, centralized record keeping, duty slip generation, and email delivery — with zero manual intervention after setup.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **server-side automation pipeline** that:

1. Accepts trip details via an n8n-hosted form  
2. Appends each trip as a new row into an existing CSV file stored on Google Drive  
3. Dynamically generates a duty slip using HTML templating  
4. Converts the HTML into an image using a headless rendering engine  
5. Sends the generated duty slip as an email attachment using SMTP  

The solution ensures **data consistency**, **auditability**, and **operational efficiency**.

## 🧠 Architecture Summary

```Form Submission (HTTP Trigger)
│
├── CSV Pipeline
│ ├── Download existing trips.csv (Google Drive API)
│ ├── Append new row (JavaScript processing)
│ └── Upload updated CSV (overwrite same file)
│
└── Document Pipeline
├── Generate HTML duty slip (templating)
├── Convert HTML → Image
└── Send email with attachment (SMTP)
```

Both pipelines run **in parallel** from a single form submission.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Uses **n8n “On Form Submission” trigger**
- Emits structured JSON containing trip details
- Acts as the single source of truth for downstream nodes

### 2. Persistent CSV Storage (Google Drive)
- Uses **Google Drive API v3**
- Downloads an existing `trips.csv` file by File ID
- Ensures all trip records are stored in one continuously growing file

### 3. CSV Append Logic
- Implemented using a **JavaScript Function node**
- Responsibilities:
  - Decode Base64 CSV content to UTF-8
  - Validate or create CSV headers
  - Escape values safely (quotes, commas)
  - Append a new row
  - Re-encode CSV to Base64 for upload

This avoids file duplication and guarantees atomic updates.

### 4. Duty Slip Generation
- Uses an **HTML template** with dynamic placeholders
- n8n expression engine (`{{$json[...]}}`) injects runtime values
- Template mirrors a real-world duty slip layout

### 5. HTML to Image Rendering
- Uses a Chromium-based headless renderer
- Converts styled HTML + CSS into a PNG image
- Ensures consistent visual output across executions

### 6. Email Delivery
- Uses **SMTP Email Send node**
- Authenticated via Gmail App Password
- Sends multipart MIME email with binary attachment
- Works independently of Gmail OAuth limitations

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
├── trips-data-automation.json # Exported n8n workflow
├── README.md # Project documentation
├── .gitignore # Excludes secrets and runtime files
└── docs/
└── architecture.png # (Optional) workflow diagram
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- No credentials or secrets are committed
- OAuth tokens and SMTP passwords are stored only in n8n credential store
- `.gitignore` explicitly excludes sensitive files
- Google OAuth client secrets must be regenerated if compromised

---

## ⚙️ Setup Requirements (High Level)

- n8n running locally or on a server (Docker recommended)
- Google Cloud project with:
  - Google Drive API enabled
  - OAuth Client (Web application)
- Gmail account with App Password enabled
- Existing `trips.csv` file in Google Drive

> Detailed setup steps are intentionally excluded from the repository to avoid leaking sensitive configuration.

---

## ✅ Key Outcomes

- Single source of truth for trip records
- No duplicate files created on Google Drive
- Automated, consistent duty slip generation
- Reduced manual operational workload
- Easily extensible for PDF generation, WhatsApp delivery, or database storage

---

## 🔄 Possible Extensions

- Replace CSV with a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Generate PDF instead of image
- Add WhatsApp or Slack notifications
- Introduce role-based access for form submissions
- Add validation and error alerting workflows
